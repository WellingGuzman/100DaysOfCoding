# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Updated an old sass/compass css styles

**Thoughts:** Had some issues with the `transform-origin`, end up being missing a third value. Somehow compass autogenerate the value but using CodeKit doesn't. I don't recall how the perspective and origin position works exactly, but next time I will find out and add a script to generate css.
